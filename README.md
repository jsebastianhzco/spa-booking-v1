# SPA Booking System – Original Version (Legacy PHP)

This project is the original version of a custom-built booking system developed around **2019–2020** for a spa and wellness center.

At the time, it was created without modern frameworks, external libraries, or containerized environments — using only raw **PHP**, **JavaScript**, **MySQL**, and **FullCalendar** for scheduling.

## 📌 Purpose

This repository is preserved as a historical and educational reference to document my evolution as a developer.

It is part of a 3-stage technical journey:

1. ✅ **This version** (2019–2020): original legacy booking system written in pure PHP.
2. 🔧 **Refactored version** (2023): improved structure and organization using better coding practices while remaining in PHP.
3. 🚀 **Migrated version** (in progress): complete reimplementation of the backend using .NET Core, Entity Framework Core, and RESTful APIs.
